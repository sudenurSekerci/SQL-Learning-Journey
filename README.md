# SQL Learning Journey
Structured SQL practice for foundational data querying skills using SQLite.

## Overview
This repository documents my early SQL practice as I build a strong foundation
in data querying, aggregation, and joins. My long-term goal is to specialize in
AI and Machine Learning, where working efficiently with data is essential.

## Topics Covered
- SELECT, WHERE
- DISTINCT
- ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET
- Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)
- GROUP BY
- Subqueries
- INNER JOIN
- String filtering with LIKE

## Repository Structure
- salaries_queries.sql – Salary-based SQL practice covering aggregation and filtering
- library_queries.sql – JOIN-focused queries using book checkout data

## How to Run
These queries are written using the SQLite dialect.
You can run them using:
- DB Browser for SQLite
- DBeaver
- Any SQLite-compatible SQL editor
