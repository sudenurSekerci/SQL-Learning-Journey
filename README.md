# SQL Practice – Fundamentals

This repository contains my early SQL practice work as I learn database querying
with a focus on data analysis foundations for future AI / Machine Learning studies.

## Purpose
I started learning SQL to build a strong foundation in data extraction,
aggregation, and filtering — essential skills for working with datasets
used in analytics and machine learning pipelines.

## Topics Covered
- SELECT, WHERE
- DISTINCT
- ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET
- Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX)
- GROUP BY
- Subqueries
- INNER JOIN
- String filtering (LIKE)
- Basic data transformations

## Database
- SQL dialect: SQLite
- Sample tables:
  - `SALARIES`
  - `CHECKED_OUT`
  - `BOOKS`

## Notes
Each query is written cleanly and includes brief comments explaining its intent.
Incorrect or ambiguous SQL patterns were avoided in favor of industry-safe queries.
